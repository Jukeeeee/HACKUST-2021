### **Theme**: Food and Beverage / Catering Technology

>What does the food and beverage industry look like in the next normal? While dine-in is expected to rebound, the habit of eating out of store is here to stay. Whether it is ordering online, picking up from stores or delivery, how do we make every customer experience remain great or even better every single time?

>**You are to develop a viable solution to meet customers’ expectation of hygiene or even go beyond that. And to inject agility into a caterer’s operations and leverage data to enable fast response to shifts between dine-in and out-of-store orders.**

Brainstorm direction:
* Hardware Solution
* Software Solution
* How fast (Long term? Short term?)

Example project directions:
* Online ordering systems and delivery apps
* Contacless payment
* Online table reservation system
* Self-serving technologies
* Real time customer tracking
